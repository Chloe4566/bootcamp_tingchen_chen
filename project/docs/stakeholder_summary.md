# Stakeholder Memo: Credit Default Risk Project

**To:** Lending Strategy Team  
**From:** Ting-Chen Chen  
**Subject:** Problem Definition & Stakeholder Context  

## Objective
Our goal is to design a predictive system that estimates the likelihood of loan default for incoming applications.  
This system will help the bank allocate credit responsibly, reduce exposure to high-risk borrowers, and improve overall portfolio stability.  

## Why It Matters
Loan defaults erode profitability, increase capital reserves, and expose the bank to reputational risk.  
A better predictive framework will allow the bank to balance growth with prudent risk management, enabling competitive but safe lending.  

## Stakeholder Persona
- **Primary User:** Credit risk analysts  
- **Motivation:** Quickly assess borrower profiles and flag high-risk applications  
- **Decision Context:** Use model scores alongside business rules to approve, decline, or adjust loan terms  

## Next Steps
1. Confirm availability and quality of historical borrower datasets.  
2. Identify which features (e.g., income stability, repayment history) will be most relevant.  
3. Define clear evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, bad-rate reduction) that align with business goals.
