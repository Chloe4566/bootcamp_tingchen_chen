# Project: Credit Default Risk Prediction

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions face significant challenges in predicting whether borrowers will default on their loans.  
Early and accurate detection of default risk is critical to minimizing financial losses and ensuring responsible lending practices.  
This project aims to build a reproducible, transparent model that estimates the probability of default for individual borrowers.

## Stakeholder Context
The primary stakeholders are **credit risk analysts** and **lending managers** at a commercial bank.  
They care about:
- Accurate risk prediction that improves loan portfolio quality
- Clear interpretation of model results to satisfy regulatory requirements
- Timely updates that reflect changing market conditions
- Practical recommendations that balance profit with risk management

## Scope & Constraints
- **Data:** Historical borrower profiles (demographics, income, credit history, transaction behavior).  
- **Assumptions:** Past borrower behavior is somewhat predictive of future defaults; data schema remains stable.  
- **Constraints:** Must avoid using sensitive or legally protected attributes (e.g., race, gender). Limited compute; solutions should run in standard enterprise environments.

## Deliverables for Stage 1 (Problem Framing & Scoping)
- Short project summary  
- Stakeholder persona and context description  
- Stakeholder memo in `/docs/`
